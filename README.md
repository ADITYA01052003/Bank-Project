Project Overview

                                  The Bank Management System is a full-stack web application built using Spring Boot that allows users to manage their banking activities such as creating an account, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account details. Each user can create only one account, ensuring data consistency and control. The system uses MySQL as a database and integrates AI-enhanced responsive frontend design for a better user experience.
